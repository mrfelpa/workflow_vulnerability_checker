# How it Works:

- You can either specify the URLs of the repositories you want to scan as command-line arguments.
Alternatively, the tool will prompt you to enter the URL if none are provided.

- The tool extracts the username and repository name from the provided URL.
- It then retrieves the list of workflows defined within the repository using the GitHub API.

- Each workflow is downloaded and analyzed for the presence of the ${{ ... }} syntax within the run and uses commands of job steps.
- Workflows containing this syntax are considered potentially vulnerable as they might be susceptible to injection attacks.

- The tool displays the results, indicating whether any vulnerable workflows were found.
- If vulnerabilities are detected, it lists the names of the affected workflows for further investigation.

# Getting Started:

- Clone the repository or save the script as a Python file.
- Install required libraries:

          pip install requests rich argparse
  
- Run the script from the command line, specifying repository URLs as arguments:

          python check_workflow_vulnerability.py https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-1 https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-2

- Alternatively, run the script without arguments to be prompted for the repository URL.
